Excerpts from undergraduate academic papers:

<h3>*Cronon, William. “A Place for Stories: Nature, History, and Narrative.” The Journal of American History 78 (1992): 1347-1376.*</h3>

William Cronon, esteemed historian, wrote a pivotal essay defending the integrity of narration in the field of history. Cronon was addressing the postmodernist’s subversive arguments that branded history as a hopeless endeavor for those interested in objective inquiry because of its literary implications. Cronon did not deny that a historian’s inherent biases would always influence their work. He did, however, argue for their place in establishing narratives. Narration helps us relate to the past in a way that not only stimulates our desire to know it, but also so that we may extract meaning from it. Plotting facts equitably onto the same timeline, without embedding their relative significance, would not help us understand how the critical moments of our past came to fruition. Cronon explained that historians have to write for an audience. In this respect, a narrative is bound by what the evidence can or cannot show (source); far-fetched claims born in the imagination and not necessitated by the facts will fail to withstand criticism.

Cronon’s essay comes as a relief to many historians, after postmodernism enveloped the field in a sort of doubt. The literary turn was an important moment in 20th century historiography nonetheless, because it forced historians to reconcile with the imperfection of their craft. Cronon showed how narratives are an essential characteristic of good history because they inspire impassioned learning.  This is its greatest benefit to society, for history only exists in the minds of people willing to know it.

<h3>*Introduction to the Deutschkonservative Partei*</h3>
Imperial Germany's conservative party was comprised of Prussian aristocrats, colloquially referred to as Junkers, that owned and drew the majority of their income from large estates in the east. Nationalism, reinforced by the Franco-Prussian war, provided the ‘mandate’ for the Conservative party’s dominance in politics, which was already firmly established under Prussia’s 3-tier suffrage system. Their sense of nationalism was confined to their region, however, which contrasted from the statewide nationalism the national liberals were touting at the time. Some Conservatives outright opposed German unification because the Reichstag provided the basis for universal manhood suffrage, and a model that could supplant and diminish Prussia’s influence. Their political platform, then, reflected their desire to maintain the status quo, and retain their privileges; they were major proponents of antisocialism. One small caveat is in order. The conservatives did support some social insurance under the pretense that it would placate workers and the sort of civil unrest that was typically conducive for revolution from below.

<h3>*Daniel Pool, What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1993).*</h3>

Daniel Pool is an author and former law professor from New York City. What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew, his most notable and celebrated book, has sold over 80,000 copies. Author Geoffrey Stokes called it simply, “indispensable.” Pool’s research was the culmination of “arcane publications”  and the collaborative efforts from a venerable cast of his peers. It certainly shows.

What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew is a glimpse into 19th century English life from every conceivable perspective. Broad, though by no means exhaustive, the book satisfies the reader’s inquiries.

Pool organized his book into two parts. The first is a categorical layering of synopses that takes the reader from the rudimentary to more complex matters in both public and private life. The second part is a valuable archive of reference materials; the glossary is particularly thorough and beneficial to the reader who may otherwise have been dumbfounded had they been left to decipher what color quelicot is on their own, or what a cotillion dance entailed.

Beginning with the basics, Pool describes the practical etymology of British currency, but cautions the reader against any presumptuous comparisons to America’s 20th century economy, which he concludes are “fundamentally incommensurable.”  The English calendar and metric system, too - with their “nettlesome English holidays”  and “quaint Anglo-Saxon measurement,”  respectively - have no parallel.
