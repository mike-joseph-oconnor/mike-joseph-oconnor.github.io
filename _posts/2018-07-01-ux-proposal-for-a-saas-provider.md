This is a redacted excerpt from a report that proposed usability enhancements to a SaaS provider's platform. The enhancements were intended to generate long-term financial incentive for the company by accelerating the learning curve and product adoption of their platform. The report was based on aggregated user feedback from field staff at their client sites and independent research. The mockups that supplemented this report contained proprietary information and were omitted.


<h1> Log In screen</h1>
The current Log In screen may subconsciously encourage absentmindedness in users due to the overabundance of white space without sufficient visual cues to direct their attention. Studies show that,

>People do judge books by their covers, Internet sites by their first pages […].
This initial impression of a system greatly influences subsequent perceptions and attitudes,
which then affects the quality of subsequent interactions” (Universal Principles of Design, 80)

This could be improved while still keeping ample white space in the virtue of simplicity. Simple measures to improve the visibility of the contents of the page could foster positive attitudes in  users.

<h1> Request Status screen</h1>
The Request Status screen is visually jarring for users due to the amount of information competing for their attention. Non-essential information should be stowed away in collapsible menus, while critical modules should be arranged sequentially, in the order of their use.

<h1> [Proprietary Feature] screen</h1>
The [Proprietary Feature] screen has two processing user fields without clear delineation between them. New users have reported difficulty distinguishing between the Processing User filter and the task to set a request to a Processing User.
